# Jessicadev Portfolio with Next.js

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/frontendjess/repoimagesportfolio/main/images/jessicadev-mockup.png)

My personal portfolio (created for school assignment) showcasing my front-end development skills, education and case works.

Live website (for school submission): https://jessicadevportfolio.netlify.app/

## Description

This personal portfolio was a course assignment for school, and our brief was to document 3 prior submissions from our final school year. I did this on top of my original personal portfolio that I had created for school as well in January 2022 where you can also see a select view other case works I have done.

## Built With

My project was built in Next.js, bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app), and I used Styled-Components and Styled-Media-Query for styling and breakpoints.
